# Holberton School - Machine Learning
## Linear Algebra
This module covers the fundamentals of Linear Algebra, essential for Machine Learning.

### General Concepts

#### **What is a vector?**
A one-dimensional array of numbers.
- **Example:** `[1, 2, 3]`

#### **What is a matrix?**
A two-dimensional array of numbers.
- **Example:** `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`

#### **What is a transpose?**
Flipping a matrix over its diagonal, swapping rows and columns.
- **Example:** Transpose of `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` is `[[1, 3], [2, 4]]`.

#### **What is the shape of a matrix?**
A tuple indicating the number of rows and columns.
- **Example:** Shape of `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]` is `(2, 3)`.

#### **What is an axis?**
A specific dimension for operations in a matrix. Axis 0 is rows, and axis 1 is columns.
- **Example:** Sum along axis 0 of `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` is `[4, 6]`.

#### **What is a slice?**
Selecting a subset of elements from an array or matrix.
- **Example:** The first row of `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]` is `[1, 2, 3]`.

#### **What are element-wise operations?*Operations are applied individually to each element in vectors or matrices.
- **Example:** Element-wise addition of `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]` is `[4, 6]`.

#### **How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?**
Joining vectors/matrices end-to-end.
- **Example:** Concatenating `[1, 2]` with `[3, 4]` gives `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

#### **What is the dot product?**
Multiplying corresponding elements of vectors and summing the results.
- **Example:** Dot product of `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]` is `11`.

#### **What is matrix multiplication?**
Multiplying two matrices by taking the dot product of rows and columns.
- **Example:** Multiplying `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` with `[[2, 0], [1, 2]]` gives `[[4, 4], [10, 8]]`.

#### **What is Numpy?**
A Python library for numerical computing, supporting large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Example:** Calculate mean using NumPy: `np.mean([1, 2, 3, 4])` is `2.5`.

#### **What is parallelization?**
Dividing a task into parts executed simultaneously on multiple processors to improve performance.
- **Example:** Parallelizing matrix addition can significantly reduce computation time.

#### **What is broadcasting?**
Arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes by "stretching" the smaller array.
- **Example:** Adding `[1, 2, 3]` to `[[1], [2], [3]]` results in `[[2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6]]`.

## NumPy `ndarray` Attributes

`numpy.ndarray` objects are equipped with a variety of attributes that provide essential information about the array's structure and behavior:

### Array Dimensions

- **`ndim`**: The number of dimensions or axes of the array.
- **`shape`**: A tuple representing the array's dimensions, showing the size of the array in each dimension.
- **`size`**: The total number of elements in the array.

### Data Type and Memory

- **`dtype`**: Describes the type of the elements in the array.
- **`itemsize`**: The size in bytes of each element in the array.
- **`data`**: The buffer containing the actual elements of the array, typically not used directly.
- **`nbytes`**: The total number of bytes required to store the array.
- **`base`**: The base object if the memory is shared; `None` if the array owns its memory.

### Memory Layout and Other Properties

- **`flags`**: Information about the memory layout and other characteristics of the array:
  - `C_CONTIGUOUS (C)`: Data is in a single, C-style contiguous segment.
  - `F_CONTIGUOUS (F)`: Data is in a single, Fortran-style contiguous segment.
  - `OWNDATA (O)`: The array owns its memory.
  - `WRITEABLE (W)`: Data can be written to; false locks the data.
  - `ALIGNED (A)`: Data and elements are appropriately aligned.
  - `UPDATEIFCOPY (U)`: This array is a copy that will update the original array upon deletion.

### Mathematical Properties

- **`T`**: Provides the transposed version of the array.
- **`real`**: The real part of the array if the elements are complex.
- **`imag`**: The imaginary part of the array if the elements are complex.

### Strides

- **`strides`**: A tuple of bytes to step in each dimension when traversing the array.

These attributes are crucial for managing and understanding the behavior of `numpy.ndarray` objects in data analysis and scientific computing.
