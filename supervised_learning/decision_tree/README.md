# Decision Trees
## Learning Objectives
### This project aims to implement decision trees from scratch. It is important for engineers to understand how the tools we use are built for two reasons. First, it gives us confidence in our skills. Second, it helps us when we need to build our own tools to solve unsolved problems. The first three references point to historical papers where the concepts were first studied. References 4 to 9 can help if you feel you need some more explanation about the way we split nodes. William A. Belson is usually credited for the invention of decision trees (read reference 11). Despite our efforts to make it efficient, we cannot compete with Sklearn’s implementations (since they are done in C). In real life, it is thus recommended to use Sklearn’s tools. In this regard, it is warmly recommended to watch the video referenced as (10) above. It shows how to use Sklearn’s decision trees and insists on the methodology.
